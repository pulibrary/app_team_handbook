# Creating Issues

We offer these guidelines to help Product Owners and others create issues with a helpful amount of initial information.
Our Technical Liaisons and Product Owners review each issue that is created, and will
ask follow-up questions if needed. Following these guidelines will help us understand, replicate, and resolve your problem or request.

## Bug issues
* Title is clear and concise
  * E.g. "Google Drive authentication does not complete"
* Expected behavior
  * E.g. "When I select google drive as a provider, I should see a directory
    navigation interface"
* Actual behavior (include screenshots, or links and browser version if relevant)
  * E.g. "I receive an error (screenshot attached, taken from Google Chrome)."
* Steps to replicate
  * E.g. "From Figgy's home page, select Scanned Resource > Bulk Ingest. Click
    'Select folder' button. Select storage provider "google drive." Log in to
    authorize google drive."
* Impact
  * E.g.
    * "I can't work until this is fixed"
    * "I have a workaround"

## Feature issues
* Title
  * Please be clear and concise
  * E.g. "PDF with embedded OCR"
* Describe your request with a user story
  * A user story follows the format: "As a __ I need __ in order to __"
  * Please be as specific as possible.
  * E.g. "As a researcher I need to download a PDF with embedded OCR so that I
    can quickly search for words without having to be online or locate the
    original resource page"
* Provide a concrete example
  * This will help us ensure the feature works for the data you're specifically using, and give us a starting point for development.
  * E.g. "I need to download a PDF of the Canterbury tales
    (b07d230f-5eee-4232-afc9-c628017b7d25) and search for the word 'Christ'."
