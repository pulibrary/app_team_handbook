# Development Practice

## Weekly schedule
- Monday Planning meeting:
  - This meeting is guided by a running agenda populated with specific issues (in the GitHub sense) based on the previous week's triaging, inbox triaging performed by individuals, or other specific questions.  Non-DRDS attendees go first with their agenda items so they can leave early if needed.  All other tickets are gone through in the order in which they are added to the agenda.
- Daily:
  - Check-in meetings: These are daily standups in the [Agile definition](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/agile/agile_daily_standup.htm).  Each attendee shares what they've been working on and what they plan to work on next, as well as any blockers or questions.  These meetings serve as status updates, and team members will coordinate additional discussion outside of the meeting.  Non-DRDS attendees give their updates first so that they can leave early if needed.
  - Self-assign an issue from the ready column for the project you're working
    on. Work individually or in a pair.
  - Ensure new / modified code has test coverage.
  - Run Rubocop to enforce code style agreed upon by our team.
  - Do not merge your own pull request. If your PR isn't getting reviewed, freely post it in slack.
  - Review other pull requests over the course of the day.
    - We generally follow the [Samvera Code Review](https://samvera.github.io/review.html) guidelines
  - Sometimes pair code review is helpful.
  - Open issues in Github as needed (check if there is a similar issue to avoid duplicates).
- Friday Wrap-up meeting: This meeting has an agenda with two sections: one focusing on the week's work that attendees populate with bullet points as representative summaries of their work that they wish to highlight in the meeting, and a section for the rest of the meetingâ€™s agenda (additional items for discussion).  Non-DRDS attendees go first.  After this, the DRDS team assigns a runner and distribute ourselves to projects for the next week.  The team then self-organizes separate group meetings afterward for work planning, triaging tickets for the following week.
