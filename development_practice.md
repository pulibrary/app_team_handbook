# Development Practice

## Weekly schedule
- Monday Planning meeting: 
  - Go through the zenhub board for each project we'll be working on. Review
      issues in the 'inbox' and triage them. See [Specifying Issues](/specifying_issues.md) for a "ready issue" checklist. Populate the 'ready' column and prioritize those issues.
- Daily: 
  - Check-in meetings: Each member of the team shares what they've been working on and what they plan to work on next, as well as any blockers or questions. Longer discussions are held for the end.
  - Self-assign an issue from the ready column for the project you're working
    on. Work individually or in a pair.
  - Ensure new / modified code has test coverage.
  - Run Rubocop to enforce code style agreed upon by our team.
  - Do not merge your own pull request. If your PR isn't getting reviewed, freely post it in slack.
  - Review other pull requests over the course of the day.
    - We generally follow the [Samvera Code Review](https://samvera.github.io/review.html) guidelines
  - Sometimes pair code review is helpful.
  - Open issues in Github as needed (check if there is a similar issue to avoid duplicates).
- Friday Wrap-up meeting: Each person reviews their work over the course of
  the week. We distribute ourselves to projects for the next week. We address other agenda
  items as they come up.
