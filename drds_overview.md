# DRDS Overview

Our team of 5.5 developers and 1 manager works primarily remotely.

## Communication channels

* [Slack](https://pulibrary.slack.com/) for quick chats, group discussions, sharing news, asking for feedback/code review, etc.
  * It's good to be generally available on Slack, but it's fine to mute/ignore/turn off as needed
* [Github](https://github.com/pulibrary) PRs/issues for code review, remembering things for later, recording feedback
* Zoom to have discussions, daily check-ins, sprint kickoff/wrapup, backlog grooming
  * If you use outlook, there’s a zoom plugin for outlook which will allow you to add a zoom meeting during scheduling
* Google Docs for drafting docs, spreadsheets, meeting notes
