# DRDS Overview

Our team of 5.5 developers and 1 manager works primarily remotely.

## Communication channels

* [Slack](https://pulibrary.slack.com/) for quick chats, group discussions, sharing news, asking for feedback/code review, etc.
  * It's good to be generally available on Slack, but it's fine to mute/ignore/turn off as needed
* [Github](https://github.com/pulibrary) PRs/issues for code review, remembering things for later, recording feedback
* Zoom to have discussions, daily check-ins, work cycle kickoff/wrapup, backlog grooming
  * If you use outlook, there’s a zoom plugin for outlook which will allow you to add a zoom meeting during scheduling
* Google Docs for drafting docs, spreadsheets, meeting notes

## Scheduled Meetings

* Monday Planning meeting (up to 1 hr):
  * This meeting is guided by a running agenda populated with specific GitHub issues based on the previous week's triaging, inbox triaging performed by individuals, or other specific questions. All tickets are discussed in the order in which they are added to the agenda. Cross-team attendees are always welcome.
* Tuesday - Thursday Check-in meetings (15 minutes):
  * These are daily standups in the [Agile definition](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/agile/agile_daily_standup.htm). Each attendee shares what they've been working on and what they plan to work on next, as well as any blockers or questions. These meetings serve as status updates, and team members will coordinate additional discussion outside of the meeting. Cross-team attendees are always welcome.
* Friday Wrap-up meeting (1 hr):
  * This meeting has an agenda with two sections: one focusing on the week's work that attendees populate with bullet points as representative summaries of their work that they wish to highlight in the meeting, and a section for the rest of the meeting’s agenda (additional items for discussion). After this, the DRDS team assigns a [runner](/runner.md) and distribute ourselves to projects for the next week. Meeting attendees then self-organize separate group meetings afterward for work planning, triaging tickets for the following week. Cross-team attendees are always welcome.
* Twice yearly team retrospectives (several hours):
  * Twice a year as part of our "All Hands" meetings we have time as a team to conduct a retrospective of our team process. This is an opportunity for everyone to share what is going well on our team and what's not working, and re-evaluate any process that we've put in place to deal with pain points to find out whether they're working. This is often a full afternoon, and sometimes results in follow-up meetings as well. We leave these meetings with specific changes to our process (often reflected in this handbook) to address the issues we discussed.
