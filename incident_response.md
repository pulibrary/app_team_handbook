# Incident Response

When you notice or are informed that an application is experiencing downtime or degraded service:

* Report it in the #incident_reports slack channel
* Any member of that slack channel may start a zoom call that everyone can join
  to coordinate a response
* On the zoom call it is helpful if one person can assume leadership for communication and coordination if needed, usually the relevant team manager if present.
