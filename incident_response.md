# Incident Response

When an application is experiencing downtime or degraded service it should be
reported in the #incident_reports slack channel. At that time any member of that
channel may start a zoom chat that everyone can join, so that we can coordinate
response to the report. It is helpful if one person can assume leadership for communication and
coordination if needed, usually the relevant team manager if present.
