# Onboarding

## Buddy System

DRDS uses a buddy system for onboarding new full-time members of the team.  New members are paired with a teammate in DRDS as their buddy on a rotating schedule throughout the onboarding process.  An onboarding buddy is a dedicated teammate who is explicitly available to help the new team member acclimate to DRDS and our projects by answering questions, assisting with DRDS onboarding activities, generally mentoring, encouraging engagement with the rest of the team, etc.  New team members and their buddies are also encouraged to engage in pair programming together, especially when acclimating to new projects, shared development practices, and handling [runner](runner.md) triaging.

Members of the team pair on a rotating schedule with the new hire to give everyone an opportunity to work together.  The first buddy pairing lasts two weeks to account for much of a new hire's first week being occupied with HR, managerial, and general onboarding activities.  After this, buddies take turns once a week.
