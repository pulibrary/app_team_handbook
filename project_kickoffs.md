# Project Kickoffs

If you're starting a new project with our team we'll want to spend a lot of time
together understanding the problem we're trying to solve and the user groups we're
hoping to serve. We'll work toward specifying a minimal viable product (MVP).
This term is used widely in different ways by different teams. When we say MVP
we mean:

* The smallest application we can develop and launch that will bring value to
  some set of users in our problem space.

This means we will constantly ask ourselves, "Are we sure this is part of an
MVP?" Developing an MVP as the first step in our project brings significant
benefits:

* Quickly launching an application to real users means we have real users to
  help guide ongoing development. This helps ensure we design and implement features that
  actually work in a real use case, and that we don't spend time writing features
  that turn out to not be as important as we may have thought.
* Defining our first milestone as narrowly as possible allows us to more quickly achieve our
  first major goal together as a partnership. This builds trust and
  confidence between our teams, and helps everyone feel successful and
  optimistic about the project. It may seem artificial but it's critical to the
  success of our collaboration.
* We can more easily schedule work on a project if its scope is easy to
  reason about. With many projects to maintain, our team needs to be able to
  commit development resources in many places. When our team has a sustainable
  development strategy, all our projects benefit.
