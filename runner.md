## How to be the runner

Each week one person from the team is assigned to be the "runner". This person watches honeybadger for all our projects and responds to new errors as they occur.

The Friday before:
- Ensure your notifications are on for all projects.

Each morning:
- Look through new errors from the weekend / night before.

When a new error comes in
- Put aside other work and spend up to 30 minutes investigating / diagnosing the error. If it can be resolved in that time, submit a PR resolving it. Otherwise, do your best to diagnose the problem and create a ticket for it. Put these tickets in the "priority" column of the relevant waffle board.
- Staging errors are probably due to development / testing. But it could be an opportunity to catch an error before we see it in production. If you're not sure, check in with the team.
- The general goal is for each error to either have an associated PR, an associated issue, or be resolved (often network issues can simply be resolved).

On Friday:
- Look through priority issues with the team during checkin and sort them into ready / backlog as appropriate.
