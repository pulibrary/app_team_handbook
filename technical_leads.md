# Technical Leads

Each project undertaken by DRDS will be assigned a technical lead as assigning
responsibility for the stewardship of an application.

## Why Technical Leads

As a team we’ve intended to cross-train on codebases as much as possible, but we can’t expect everybody to know everything about all of our projects. By assigning technical leads we can ensure that each of our projects are stewarded, looked over, and thought about reliably.

## Requirements to be Technical Lead

1. Have been a member of the team for six months or hired for the purpose of
   leading a particular project.
1. Have the capacity to take on leadership of a project.

## Responsibilities of a Technical Lead

1. Have as comprehensive as possible knowledge of the technical workings of the
   product and document them appropriately.
1. Collaborate closely with the product owner to prioritize issues and
   ensure the backlog is groomed appropriately. This work may be delegated or
   shared.
1. Ensure reviews are happening on your project.
1. Act as an authority on questions regarding the technical direction of
   features. When possible document possible solutions in tickets as a part of
   backlog grooming.
1. Transfer knowledge of the product to other team members through training,
   pairing, documentation, and other means. You should never be the only one who can troubleshoot and maintain the code base.
