# Technical Liaisons

Each project undertaken by DRDS will be assigned a technical liaison as assigning
responsibility for the stewardship of an application.

## Why Technical Liaisons

As a team we’ve intended to cross-train on codebases as much as possible, but we can’t expect everybody to know everything about all of our projects. By assigning technical liaisons we can ensure that each of our projects are stewarded, looked over, and thought about reliably.

A technical liaison is not necessarily the technical authority or expert on the
codebase they steward. Technical and architectural decisions are a team effort.

## Responsibilities of a Technical Liaisons

1. Collaborate closely with the product owner to prioritize issues and
   ensure the backlog is groomed appropriately. This work may be delegated or
   shared.
1. Ensure reviews are happening on the project.
1. Ensure the project is sufficiently documented.
1. Triage the inbox for the project's zenhub board, and add issues that require
   further discussion to the Monday team meeting agenda.
1. Ensure github issues are well-specified and actionable.
1. Participate in work cycles for the project.
