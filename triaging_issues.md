What makes an issue "ready"? A brief checklist for developers to use when
triaging issues.

## Bug issues
* Title is clear and concise
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior (do we have screenshots, links, browser version if relevant?)
* Steps to replicate
* Clear acceptance criteria: "This issue can be closed when the following is
  true"
* Impact on user is clear

## Feature issues
* Title is clear and concise
* Presents a user story: "As a __ I need __ in order to __"
* Provides actual or sample data: Do we have a case to develop and test against?
* Clear acceptance criteria: "This issue can be closed when the following is
  true"
