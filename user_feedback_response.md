# User Feedback/Feature Request Procedures

Outlined below are a few scenarios for how to respond and organize feature
requests and bug fixes for users.

## User sends a feature request to your personal email address.

1. Create an Incident Report at
   https://princeton.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fincident.do%3Fsys_id%3D-1%26sysparm_query%3Dactive%3Dtrue%26sysparm_stack%3Dincident_list.do%3Fsysparm_query%3Dactive%3Dtrue
   * Ensure you choose the appropriate application so it gets assigned to the
   right group. You can filter to our applications by choosing Primary Support
   Group in the search box and searching for "Library." You'll want one that's
   assigned to the Library Applications Team.
1. Go to "My Submissions" at
   https://princeton.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fincident_list.do%3Fsysparm_userpref_module%3D087800c1c0a80164004e32c8a64a97c9%26sysparm_query%3Dcaller_id%3Djavascript:gs.getUserID()%5EORu_affected_user%3Djavascript:gs.getUserID()%5EORopened_byDYNAMIC90d1921e5f510100a9ad2572f2b477fe%5Eactive%3Dtrue%5EEQ%26caller_id%3Djavascript:gs.getUserID()%5Eactive%3Dtrue%26sysparm_clear_stack%3Dtrue
1. Click the incident you just created, and copy the link
1. Create a Github ticket in the appropriate repository, give it the SNAP Ticket
   label. Paste the SNAP link (it will be long) into the description.
1. If you have any questions for the user, type them into the SNAP ticket with
   the "Customer Comment" checkbox checked.
1. Discuss the Github Ticket at Monday standup. If it's moved to the backlog,
   resolve the issue and provide appropriate information as well as the Github
   Issue link. If it's not moved to the backlog, delete the Github Issue and
   resolve the SNAP ticket with appropriate information.
