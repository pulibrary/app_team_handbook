# DRDS Work Cycles and Practices

## Work Cycles

Our team works in 2-week cycles, aka "sprints". We usually split into 2 sub-teams in each
cycle, with each sub-team working on a different application or project. This means that we work on a prioritized subset of applications for each sprint.

We track all our work in github issues and zenhub boards. Each project has a github repository. In most cases the issues from that repository are organized into columns on the corresponding zenhub board. These resources are listed on the [List of Applications](https://github.com/pulibrary/app_team_handbook/blob/master/applications.md)

At the beginning of each cycle we have a planning meeting to triage incoming
issues and decide which issues we will be working on during that cycle. Issues
we plan to work during that cycle are placed in the "ready" column of the zenhub
board. We order them roughly by priority. Over the course of the cycle individual developers will select issues, move them to the "in progress" column, and mark them assigned. When issues are complete they'll be closed.

## Communication

Our team communicates primarily over slack. This allows us to quickly and easily
reach out to one another and to product owners and other stakeholders. While writing code often happens individually, software development is a highly collaborative activity. Knowledge about our applications, systems, interfaces, users, and use cases are distributed throughout our team and other teams (such as the Enterprise and User Services team, the Operations team, our product owners who come from many other departments, and the users of our applications).

We use github as outlined above to record use cases, progress on work, and decisions that impact the work on a particular issue.

We also frequently communicate on zoom. We hold all meetings this way and our
team culture is to attend meetings with video activated when possible. We also
use zoom throughout the day to demonstrate software functionality or bugs, or
when a slack conversation becomes unwieldy.

Finally, we use Google drive to record notes for meetings or produce design
documents.

## Technical Leads

Each of our projects has an assigned technical lead. This person will work most
closely with product owners to ensure issues are prioritized appropriately.
However, many members of our team work on each application and we rotate frequently. We strive to ensure Technical Leads do not become a bottleneck to our process,
and to that end we encourage communication on slack channels rather than individual
emails. For more information on technical leads, see [Technical Leads](https://github.com/pulibrary/app_team_handbook/blob/master/technical_leads.md)
